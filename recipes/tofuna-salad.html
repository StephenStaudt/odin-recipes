        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Tofuna salad/sandwich spread as seen on TheVeganAtlas.com</p>
            <p>Simple tuna-style salad/spread made vegan. This recipe uses baked tofu and makes a great sandwich filling or topping for leafy greens.</p>

        <h3>Notes</h3>
            <p>This recipe is very flexible. I usually wing it and make a double or triple batch as I balance out the flavors I want.</p>
            <p>I wouldn't try all the optional ingredients at once, just mix and match a few based on your preferred flavors.</p>
            <p>Flavored baked tofu comes in a variety of styles. Smoked and savory are both good. Avoid strong flavors that seem off-theme like teriyaki.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>8 oz baked tofu (see note)</li>
                <li>1/3-1/2 cup vegan mayonnaise</li>
                <li>1 large celery stalk finely diced</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Optional Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 scallion, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>1/3 red onion, finely diced</li>
                <li>1-2 tbsp brown or spicy mustard to taste (note: reduce mayo)</li>
                <li>1-2 tbsp pickle relish to taste (note: reduce mayo)</li>
                <li>Freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 tbsp nutritional yeast</li>
                <li>Celery salt, to taste</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Crumble tofu finely, or use food processor, pulsing until finely and evenly chopped.</li>
                <li>Add mayonnaise, celery, and any optional ingredients. Mix well.</li>
                <li>Adjust as desired, if the texture is too creamy (too much mayo), add more tofu. If you want more flavors, see optional ingredients. If flavors are too strong, add more mayo and tofu.</li>
                <li>Serve however desired. I like sandwiches with toasted bread, lettuce, and tomato</li>
            </ul>
