        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Air Fryer Turmeric Cauliflower as seen on WholesomeMadeEasy.com</p>
            <p>This simple recipe takes less than 10 minutes of prep and 15-20 minutes in your airfryer.</p>

        <h3>Additional Notes</h3>
            <p><strong>Turmeric leaves yellow stains, beware!!</strong> </p>
            <p>Spice blends like Penzey's Curry spice are a great option instead of the spices listed. Read their ingredients carefully and add salt as needed.</p>
            <p>Spice and oil measurements are based on using a medium sized head of cauliflower. Adjust them up or down as needed.</p>
            <p>When adding spices to the cauliflower, i like to shake 1/4-1/3 on at a time to avoid clumping and get a more even spread.</p>
